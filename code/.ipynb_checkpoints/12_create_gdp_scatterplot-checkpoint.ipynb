      "RECENT SURFACE MOVEMENTS IN THE BALDWIN HILLS LOS ANGELES COUNTY CALIFORNIAThe various clearly defined spatial and temporal relations between subsidence and oilfield operations that have been demonstrated both for this and other oil fields indicate that the differential subsidence and associated horizontal movements generated in the Baldwin Hills are due to exploitation of the Inglewood oil field This conclusion is strengthened by various theoretical considerations and a host of experimental studies Neither the actual changes in groundwater and loading conditions nor the effects of the maximum conceivable changes in these regimens can explain the observed subsidence tectonic activity is considered an equally implausible explanation of the differential subsidence Another conclusion is that the contemporary cracking and faulting are also due largely or entirely to the exploitation of the Inglewood oil field Maps are included in the back pocket Refs\n",

      "A FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF CONTAMINANT MOVEMENT IN GROUNDWATERABSTRACT Transient twodimensional solutions are developed which describe the movement and distribution of a conservative substance in a streamaquifer system The solutions are obtained by solving sequentially the groundwater flow and mass transport equations A variational approach in conjunction with the finite element method is used to solve the groundwater flow equation Galerkins approach coupled with the finite element method is used to solve the mass transport equation Linear approximated triangular elements and a centered scheme of numerical integration are employed to calculate the hydraulic head distribution and the concentration of solute in the flow region The linear approximation used to define the concentration function within each element is not appropriate for cases involving steep concentration gradients For such cases higher order approximations are necessary to assure the continuity of gradients across interelemental boundaries Numerical examples that illustrate the applicability of the model are presented Copyright   Wiley Blackwell All rights reserved\n",
