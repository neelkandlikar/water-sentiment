      "A water supply company is probably the only type of company which cannot lay down stringent regulations as regards the quality of its raw materials and at the same time meet strict quality regulations for its end product. After sketching quantity and quality of the Dutch water resources (industry uses almost as much as the drinking water supply companies) a general outline of the surface water situation is given. Approximately 70% of all surface water entering the Netherlands comes in with the Rhine. Whereas ground water problems mostly involve quantity considerations, surface water exploitation meets quality problems. An overview of the activities of the 2 principal bodies concerned with Rhine water purity (International Rhine Commission, EEC Council) concludes the article.\n",
